*******Basic Intro*******
We are creating a system for our college, where the student can open a bank account in college.
This will be managed by the college, which increase the security by knowing on what the students are spending their money.

*******USING RFID*******
Also we use RFID integrated ID cards, to make the payment process faster in the campus.
Not only the payments but also include library in-out status and many more.

*******About the code*******
There is a specified app, for this to manage this account.
Here i have included an example with taking "Gitam crave" as a food store, in which we are able to use RFID payment method.
In case if the RFID not works then there is also QR included in the app.
